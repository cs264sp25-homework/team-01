           1. Creating clear headings to break up sections
           2. Organizing information into relevant bullet points
           3. Adding sub-bullets to expand on unclear points
           4. Maintaining all original formatting (bold, underline, etc.)
           5. Preserving any special styling and colors from the original
          
           EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
           1. You MUST return ALL content from the original notes - don't lose any information - but add infromation based on below instructions.
           2. Your response MUST be a valid JSON ARRAY (starting with [ and ending with ])
           3. Return the same structure but better organized, with all original nodes preserved
           4. Each object in the array must have all its original properties
           5. DO NOT wrap your response in markdown code blocks or any formatting
          
           The notes are structured as an array of objects with:
           - "type" property (usually "p" for paragraph)
           - "children" array with text content and formatting attributes
           - "id" property that must be preserved
           - Other properties like "indent", "listStyleType" that must be kept

           ABOVE IS JUST FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING


           Note, in general their are types which consist of <p> for paragraph ,<h1> for heading 1, <h2> for heading 2, <h3> for heading 3, <h4> for heading 4, <h5> for heading 5, <h6> for heading 6.
           There are also Lists which consist of <ul> for unordered list and <ol> for ordered list. and <li> for list items.
           you can set the text to bold, underlined, italic or update the font size. "bold":true,"fontSize":"21px" "underline":true "italic":true






           Steps to follow:
               1. read and understand all of the notes passed into you.
               2. If you see a few similar sentences grouped together, add a relevent heading tag above.
               3. if you see a list or bulleted list of items expand on the sentences by adding sub-bullets.
                   for example if you see a bulleted list which can be recognized because of the "indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc" property, expand on the sentences by adding sub-bullets.
                   below is an example of a bulleted list:
                   {"type":"p","id":"6Ii_utsjBT","align":"left","children":[{"text":"optimization "}],"indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc"},
                   {"type":"p","id":"cLz6RH1qEU","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"scalability "}],"listStart":2},
                   {"type":"p","id":"SmjNjpoBkL","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":3,"children":[{"text":"iterative improvement "}]},{"type":"p","id":"-tSEqK2DkS","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":4,"children":[{"text":"flexibility "}]},{"type":"p","id":"7MyPW1DgO0","align":"left","children":[{"text":""}]}


                   example of a bulleted list with sub-bullets:
                   {"type":"p","id":"6Ii_utsjBT","align":"left","children":[{"text":"optimization"}],"indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc"},
                   {"type":"p","id":"0NQjCPLdmn","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"Gradient descent helps find the minimum of a loss function, which corresponds to the optimal parameters for a model. By minimizing the loss, the model's predictions become more accurate."}]},
                   {"type":"p","id":"cLz6RH1qEU","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"scalability "}],"listStart":2},
                   {"type":"p","id":"jxOf4WbPMi","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"gradient descent is efficient and scalable for large datasets and complex models, making it suitable for deep learning applicationa where datasets can be large and models have milions of paramaters"}]},
                   {"type":"p","id":"SmjNjpoBkL","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":3,"children":[{"text":"iterative improvement "}]},
                   {"type":"p","id":"OYjaidQxJ5","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"it provides a system way to iteratively improve the models weights"}]},
                   {"type":"p","id":"-tSEqK2DkS","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":4,"children":[{"text":"flexibility "}]},
                   {"type":"p","id":"4AHkKqtaP-","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"their are various forms such as batch, stochastic and mini batch which offer flexibility in terms of computational complexity"}]}
                   Notice how you can define the elements of the list with an indent and listStart. sub bullets have a higher indent no list start.


                   When you see a list, add proper sub-bullets based on the context of the entire note focusing more on immediate context.
               
               4. if you see a list of items that are not related to the current section, add a new heading tag above.
               5. if you see a long paragraph on a topic insert a list below with the key points of the paragraph.
               6. If you see any sections that seem vague or lack proper explanation, indented underneath add context/explanation.


               MAKE SURE TO RETURN A NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION OF THE NOTES
          
           NEVER RETURN A SINGLE OBJECT - ALWAYS RETURN AN ARRAY OF OBJECTS

            Your output should be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
            {
              "nodes": [
                {
                  "id": "unique_id_1",
                  "type": "default",
                  "data": { "label": "Concept 1" },
                  "position": { "x": 0, "y": 0 }
                },
                ...
              ],
              "edges": [
                {
                  "id": "unique_edge_id_1",
                  "source": "unique_id_1",
                  "target": "unique_id_2",
                  "label": "relationship"
                },
                ...
              ]
            }
            
            Concept Map Structure Rules:
            1. Create a clear HIERARCHICAL structure:
               - Main concept at the top center
               - Sub-concepts branch out below in a tree-like structure
               - Maximum of 3 levels deep
               - Avoid horizontal connections at the same level when possible
            
            2. Node Limits and Selection:
               - Include 5-7 nodes total (not counting the main concept)
               - Focus on the most important concepts only
               - Combine similar concepts
               - Ensure each node adds unique value
               - Limit to maximum 3 nodes per level
               - Keep node labels short (maximum 20 characters if possible)
            
            3. Node Positioning and Spacing:
               - Canvas dimensions: 1200px wide (x: 0 to 1200) Ã— 600px high (y: 0 to 600)
               - Main concept: centered at (600, 50)
               
               - Level 1 nodes (y = 200):
                 * For 1 node: x = 600
                 * For 2 nodes: x = 300, 900
                 * For 3 nodes: x = 200, 600, 1000
               
               - Level 2 nodes (y = 400):
                 * Position relative to parent with minimum 400px horizontal spacing
                 * Left child: parent.x - 400
                 * Right child: parent.x + 400
                 * If single child: parent.x
               
               - Spacing Rules:
                 * Minimum 400px horizontal spacing between ANY two nodes at the same level
                 * For nodes with labels > 15 characters, increase horizontal spacing to 500px
                 * 200px minimum vertical spacing between levels
                 * When positioning nodes, account for label length:
                   - Short labels (<= 15 chars): normal spacing
                   - Medium labels (16-25 chars): add 100px to spacing
                   - Long labels (>25 chars): add 200px to spacing
            
            4. Edge Guidelines:
               - Use clear, concise relationship labels (2-3 words maximum)
               - Relationships should flow from general to specific
               - Use consistent relationship types:
                 * "consists of", "includes", "contains" for part-whole
                 * "leads to", "results in" for cause-effect
                 * "influences", "affects" for relationships
                 * "requires", "needs" for dependencies
            
            5. Layout Balance:
               - Center the entire concept map around x = 600
               - Ensure symmetrical distribution when possible
               - If nodes have long labels:
                 * Stagger their vertical positions slightly (Â±50px)
                 * Increase horizontal spacing between them
               - For adjacent nodes with long labels, offset one slightly lower
                 than the other to prevent overlap
            
            6. Node Placement Strategy:
               - Start with the widest spacing possible within the canvas
               - When placing nodes at the same level:
                 * Calculate approximate label width (characters Ã— 10px)
                 * Add 100px padding between nodes
                 * Adjust positions to prevent any potential overlap
               - If two nodes would be closer than 400px, offset one vertically
                 by 50px down
            
            7. Special Cases:
               - For nodes with labels > 25 characters:
                 * Consider breaking into two lines using " - " or ": "
                 * If breaking is not possible, ensure extra spacing
               - When multiple long-label nodes are on the same level:
                 * Alternate their y-positions slightly (Â±30px)
                 * Increase horizontal spacing between them by 100px
            
            Do not include any explanation or text outside the JSON structure.
            Make sure the output is valid JSON that can be parsed.
