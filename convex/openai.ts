            1. Creating clear headings to break up sections
            2. Organizing information into relevant bullet points
            3. Adding sub-bullets to expand on unclear points
            4. Maintaining all original formatting (bold, underline, etc.)
            5. Preserving any special styling and colors from the original
            
            EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: 
            1. You MUST return ALL content from the original notes - don't lose any information - but add infromation based on below instructions.
            2. Your response MUST be a valid JSON ARRAY (starting with [ and ending with ])
            3. Return the same structure but better organized, with all original nodes preserved
            4. Each object in the array must have all its original properties
            5. DO NOT wrap your response in markdown code blocks or any formatting
            
            The notes are structured as an array of objects with:
            - "type" property (usually "p" for paragraph)
            - "children" array with text content and formatting attributes
            - "id" property that must be preserved
            - Other properties like "indent", "listStyleType" that must be kept

            ABOVE IS JUST FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING 

            Note, in general their are types which consist of <p> for paragraph ,<h1> for heading 1, <h2> for heading 2, <h3> for heading 3, <h4> for heading 4, <h5> for heading 5, <h6> for heading 6. 
            There are also Lists which consist of <ul> for unordered list and <ol> for ordered list. and <li> for list items.
            you can set the text to bold, underlined, italic or update the font size. "bold":true,"fontSize":"21px" "underline":true "italic":true



            Steps to follow:
                1. read and understand all of the notes passed into you. 
                2. If you see a few similar sentences grouped together, add a relevent heading tag above. 
                3. if you see a list or bulleted list of items expand on the sentences by adding sub-bullets.
                    for example if you see a bulleted list which can be recognized because of the "indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc" property, expand on the sentences by adding sub-bullets.
                    below is an example of a bulleted list:
                    {"type":"p","id":"6Ii_utsjBT","align":"left","children":[{"text":"optimization "}],"indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc"},
                    {"type":"p","id":"cLz6RH1qEU","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"scalability "}],"listStart":2},
                    {"type":"p","id":"SmjNjpoBkL","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":3,"children":[{"text":"iterative improvement "}]},{"type":"p","id":"-tSEqK2DkS","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":4,"children":[{"text":"flexibility "}]},{"type":"p","id":"7MyPW1DgO0","align":"left","children":[{"text":""}]} 

                    example of a bulleted list with sub-bullets:
                    {"type":"p","id":"6Ii_utsjBT","align":"left","children":[{"text":"optimization"}],"indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc"},
                    {"type":"p","id":"0NQjCPLdmn","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"Gradient descent helps find the minimum of a loss function, which corresponds to the optimal parameters for a model. By minimizing the loss, the model's predictions become more accurate."}]},
                    {"type":"p","id":"cLz6RH1qEU","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"scalability "}],"listStart":2},
                    {"type":"p","id":"jxOf4WbPMi","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"gradient descent is efficient and scalable for large datasets and complex models, making it suitable for deep learning applicationa where datasets can be large and models have milions of paramaters"}]},
                    {"type":"p","id":"SmjNjpoBkL","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":3,"children":[{"text":"iterative improvement "}]},
                    {"type":"p","id":"OYjaidQxJ5","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"it provides a system way to iteratively improve the models weights"}]},
                    {"type":"p","id":"-tSEqK2DkS","align":"left","indent":1,"listStyleType":"disc","listStart":4,"children":[{"text":"flexibility "}]},
                    {"type":"p","id":"4AHkKqtaP-","align":"left","indent":2,"listStyleType":"disc","children":[{"text":"their are various forms such as batch, stochastic and mini batch which offer flexibility in terms of computational complexity"}]}
                    Notice how you can define the elements of the list with an indent and listStart. sub bullets have a higher indent no list start.

                    When you see a list, add proper sub-bullets based on the context of the entire note focusing more on immediate context.
                 
                4. if you see a list of items that are not related to the current section, add a new heading tag above.
                5. if you see a long paragraph on a topic insert a list below with the key points of the paragraph. 
                6. If you see any sections that seem vague or lack proper explanation, indented underneath add context/explanation. 

                MAKE SURE TO RETURN A NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION OF THE NOTES
            
            NEVER RETURN A SINGLE OBJECT - ALWAYS RETURN AN ARRAY OF OBJECTS
