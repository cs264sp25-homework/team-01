# Project Proposal
We are building a sophisticated note-taking application that combines traditional document editing capabilities with AI-powered features to enhance the note-taking and studying experience.


## Functional Requirements


### General Features
- User sign in
- File/doc upload option
- Note creation and storage system
- General text editing

The following features could be implemented, if time permits:
- Ability to create multiple note pages
- Ability to share with friends via email 


The following features would be nice to have but won't be implemented:
- Real-time collaborative document editing
- Download to desktop


### AI Features
- Autocomplete text generation (comes with novel)
- Condensing a PowerPoint into structured notes
- Fix spelling and grammar, shorten, lengthen, paraphrase, summarization features for text
- Chat interface with Notes 
- Semantic Search through the document, can "chat" with it (maybe with a chat sidebar)
- Generate quiz / test questions from notes
- Text summarization for complex topics or large text
- Create outline or proper structure for text 
- Organize notes

The following features could be implemented, if time permits:
- Create flashcards / quizlet flash cards from notes 
- Maybe a diff screen..
- Maybe just make test questions as we're doing this in a text editor
- Citation generation for formal texts


The following features would be nice to have but won't be implemented:
- Scan notes and perform google search for further exploration
- Maybe link articles or relevant youtube videos 
- Use open tabs on browser as context for autocompletions 
- Speech-to-text for lecture note transcription


### Tech Stack
- Use Novel for text editing features
- TailWindCss for styling and ShadCn UI components
- React for frontend
- Convex/Pinecone for backend
- VercelAI SDK 
- Nanostores and its routing libraries
